### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tufftoken as a frontend developer. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DeFi Projects or any other new crypto technologies that are new.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding my first job. I recently graduated from a Full Stack coding bootcamp at GA Tech. I graduated on June 15 and I am an aspiring DevOps Engineer. I am excited to start my new career in the tech space preferably with crypto. I previously worked as a Financial Advisor for Merrill Lynch for about 9 years.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the current market conditions. I am obsessed with traditional finance and this new modern day approach we are seeing with crypto. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: woodstr3313@gmail.com 
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time I love to golf, fish, watching braves baseball or being out on the lake with my friends and family.
