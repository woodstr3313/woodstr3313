### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at RevStar Consulting as a Senior Product Manager. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DeFi Projects or any other new crypto technologies that are new.
- ðŸ¤” I'm passionate about propelling my career in Product Management and securing my ideal role. Guiding clients in shaping and bringing their MVPs to life, and strategically mapping their success, is a fulfilling endeavor for me. Witnessing their dreams materialize is truly inspiring. Moreover, I find great joy in leveraging data to generate innovative ideas, empowering business owners to implement imaginative solutions. I'm eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to drive impactful projects and achieve both personal and professional milestones in the realm of Product Management.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the current market conditions. I am obsessed with traditional finance and this new modern day approach we are seeing with crypto.
