### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my React Portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning ReactJS at Georgia Tech. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Defi Projects or any other new cyrpto technologies that are new.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding my first job. I am currently attending a Full Stack coding bootcamp at GA Tech. I graduate in June and I am an asspiring DevOps engineer. I am excited to start my new career in the tech space preferably with crypto. I previously worked as a Fianacial Advisor for Merrill Lynch for about 9 years.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the current market conditions. I am obsessed with traditional finance and this new modern day approach we are seeing with crypto.
